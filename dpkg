# Plain dumb Debian's dpkg replacement just for eparakstitajs3 package
#   version checking. Uses pacman to get info on the package and prints
#   out stripped down package info.
#
# Judging by verbose eparakstitajs3 output it tries to call
#   `dpkg -s package-name`
#   to see if needed packages are installed and up to date. It seems to look
#   for Version: and Status: lines, so we print them out.
